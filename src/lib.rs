//! `oi` provides location-annotated `io::Errors` so you can display useful error messages to your users.
//!
//! Error messages without location information are often not actionable, especially when they come from a complex program with many potential sources of errors.
//!
//! Compare an unannotated error:
//!
//! ```sh
//! $ foo
//! No such file or directory (os error 2)
//! ```
//!
//! â€¦with an annotated error:
//!
//! ```sh
//! $ foo
//! Configuration.toml: No such file or directory (os error 2)
//! ```
//!
//! Aside from being "io" backwards, `oi` is also an exclamation, as in [Oi! Oi! Oi!](https://youtu.be/XWLU76o5rEI). Imagine alerting your users to the location of errors: "Oi! 1.2.3.4 is unreachable!"
